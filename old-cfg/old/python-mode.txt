Py mode defined in `python-mode.el':
Major mode for editing Python files.

To submit a problem report, enter `C-c C-b' from a
`python-mode' buffer.  Do `C-c ?' for detailed
documentation.  To see what version of `python-mode' you are running,
enter `C-c C-v'.

This mode knows about Python indentation, tokens, comments and
continuation lines.  Paragraphs are separated by blank lines only.
