;; Make Emacs know about Mallard documents
;;
;; To ensure that this works, load a .page file (a Mallard document)
;; and check for these:
;;
;; 1. The modeline should show nXML mode.
;;
;; 2. Hit C-c C-s C-w and the minibuffer should tell you, "Using schema /usr/share/xml/mallard/1.0/mallard.rnc"
;;    or something similar.  If it tells you "Using vacuous schema" instead, it means
;;    that nxml-mode did not find the mallard.rnc file on your system.  Check that the
;;    path for mallard.rnc is correct in gnome-emacs-utils/mallard-locating-schema.xml

;; We advice nxml-mode with our checking code, instead of putting
;; something in nxml-mode-hook, as the hook will not run if an error
;; happens while the nxml-mode function is being run.  For example,
;; a hook would not run if nxml-mode fails to open the mallard.rnc file.

is a .page file (i.e. a Mallard document).  If so, this funtion checks that
the RNG/RNC schema file for Mallard is indeed being used, and tells the
user about it.  This is to ensure that Mallard's schema files and
gnome-emacs-utils in general are installed correctly."
